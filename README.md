# namerizer

A silly puppeteer program I wrote to randomize my disply name on a relatively niche (but awesom) website. I run it as a cron job daily. It's configured to work on a raspberry pi (raspbian) but it could be easily adapted to anything probably. Shout out to chatGPT for the list of 1,000 adjectives.
